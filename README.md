# Establish-the-product-startup-ML

My Friend has developed the Product and he wants to 
establish the product startup and he is searching for a perfect 
location where getting the investment has a high chance. But 
due to its financial restriction, he can choose only between 
three locations - Bangalore, Mumbai, and NCR. As a friend, 
you want to help your friend deciding the location. NCR 
include Gurgaon, Noida and New Delhi. Find the location 
where the most number of funding is done. That means, find 
the location where startups has received funding maximum 
number of times. Plot the bar graph between location and 
number of funding. Take city name "Delhi" as "New Delhi".
Check the case-sensitiveness of cities also. That means, at 
some place instead of "Bangalore", "bangalore" is given. Take 
city name as "Bangalore". For few startups multiple locations 
are given, one Indian and one Foreign. Consider the startup if 
any one of the city lies in given locations.
